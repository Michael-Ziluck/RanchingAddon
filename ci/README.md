# Automated builds and releases

GitHub Actions builds, checks, and packages every push to `main`, every pull request targeting
`main`, and manual workflow runs. ZIPs and a reference-version report are saved as workflow artifacts.
Pull requests only build; publishing jobs run from `main` after a successful build.

Hosted Windows runners download the Valheim dedicated server anonymously with SteamCMD for its
actual game assemblies, and a checksum-pinned BepInExPack. No Steam login or game assemblies are
stored in Git. References are cached; change `referenceRevision` in `dependencies.json` to refresh
the game cache. The bootstrap rejects game versions outside Valheim 1.x.

## Security analysis

The `CodeQL` workflow runs extended C# and GitHub Actions security queries on pushes,
pull requests, and a weekly schedule. C# uses a traced manual build after obtaining the
same game and BepInEx references as the release build. It compiles only the production
project, not the test projects containing simulated game types. This avoids the incomplete
dependency resolution of GitHub's default no-build C# scan.

GitHub CodeQL default setup must remain disabled because this repository uses advanced
setup in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`. Other security features remain enabled.

## Publication settings

Repository variables:

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RELEASE_PUBLISH_ENABLED | true | Create `vX.Y.Z` GitHub releases with the ZIP. |
| THUNDERSTORE_PUBLISH_ENABLED | true | Upload new versions to DocZee on Thunderstore. |
| HEXIUM_PUBLISH_ENABLED | true | Upload new versions to DocZee on Hexium. |

Repository secrets:

- `THUNDERSTORE_API_TOKEN`: the DocZee service-account token.
- `HEXIUM_API_TOKEN`: a Hexium API token with permission to upload under DocZee. It is a separate token.

Packages use the Valheim community. Both registries receive the same built ZIP, with metadata
derived from its manifest. Hexium's API documents Thunderstore-compatible upload endpoints;
`ci/Publish-Hexium.ps1` uses the same pinned CLI against `https://valheim.hexium.gg`.
Hexium publication uses the DocZee team token stored in the HEXIUM_API_TOKEN repository secret.

## Release a change

1. Update the version in the project, plugin declaration, and `manifest.json`; add changelog notes.
2. Commit and push to `main`.
3. Review the build and publication jobs in Actions.

Registries do not allow overwriting a version. A push with an already published version still
builds but skips uploading that registry's existing version. Failed uploads can be retried by
rerunning the workflow; each registry is checked independently. If only Hexium is enabled later,
rerun on `main` to publish the current version there without republishing Thunderstore.

Local commands:

```powershell
./ci/Build.ps1
./ci/Publish.ps1 -WhatIf
./ci/Publish-Hexium.ps1 -WhatIf
```
